Wrinkles

Wrinkles

Wrinkles everywhere

Though her body has many

But her brain has more*

Wrinkles storing

Knowledge

Wisdom

Good advice

Lots are hidden

Within those wrinkles
⠀
⠀

Wrinkles of her body

Wrinkles of her age

Those are many

But compared to those of her brain

Those are few

As few as the good teachers like her
⠀
⠀

Though she uses not-so-polite-sounding language #Is this a better word?

"u gundu ah?"

She still cares for us

**Poor #What are these describing?

**Naïve

**Innocent

**Unaware

**Scared

**Weak

**Afraid

Young sec ones

She is like a mother

Caring for our studies

Caring for our future

Harshly but firmly #will firmly be a better word?

Leading us to the right path
