# Teacher's day thing
*Ms Vaz*


Wrinkles

wrinkles

wrinkles everywhere

though her body has many

but her brain has more

wrinkles storing

knowledge

wisdom

good advice

lots are hidden

within those wrinkles
_

wrinkles of her body

wrinkles of her age

those are many

but compared to those of her brain

those are few

as few as the good teachers like she
_

though she uses not-so-happy-sounding language

"u gundu ah?"

she still cares for us

poor 

na√Øve

innocent

unaware

scared

weak

afraid

young sec ones

she is like a mother

caring for our studies

caring for our future

harshly but surely

leading us to the right path
